# 🍿 Netflix Clone App UI with Flutter

This project is only based on th UI part of Netflix . I have used some APIs from TMDB movie database ( https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) to fetch the movie/TVshows details (such as Trending/UpComing/NowPlaying etc...) from the internet , and show it in the app's ui .  


## Packages Used
     1.http - The http package helps to perform all types of network requests in Flutter.
     2.flutter_bloc - Flutter BLoC is used to manage the state. bloc allows handling all possible states of the application easily.
     3.video_player - to play videos on your flutter app 
     4.bordered_text - for applying subtle stroke to a Text widget
     5.intl - i used this package to format the date given from the apidata to some other format
