# üçø Netflix Clone App UI with Flutter

This project is only based on th UI part of Netflix . I have used some APIs from TMDB movie database ( https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) to fetch the list of movie/TVshows details (such as Trending/UpComing/NowPlaying etc...) from the internet , and show it in the app's ui .  

By using the TMDB website Api , the movie data in the app is always updated , and the app looks more real.
Also movie videos are not available from this TMDB Api .

## Packages Used
     1.http  - The http package helps to perform all types of network requests in Flutter.
     2.flutter_bloc  - Flutter BLoC is used to manage the state. bloc allows handling all possible states of the application easily.
     3.video_player  - to play videos on your flutter app 
     4.bordered_text  - for applying subtle stroke to a Text widget
     5.intl  - i used this package to format the date given from the apidata to some other format
  
 You can get these packages from pub.dev https://pub.dev/
