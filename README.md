# 🍿 Netflix Clone App UI with Flutter

This project is only based on th UI part of Netflix . I have used some APIs from TMDB movie database ( https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) to fetch the movie/TVshows details (such as Trending/UpComing/NowPlaying etc...) from the internet , and show it in the app's ui .
